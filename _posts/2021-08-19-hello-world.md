Today, we're launching the Late Bloomer Cycling website! Yey!

But before anything else, let me tell you a bit of my story...

My last sport was Jiujitsu, coming from Boxing and Muay Thai. Even though these sports required a lot of cardio, I really hated it. I liked the grind, learning the techniques, but not the time I spent on the treadmill. I did if for years. I wasn't really good at it, but I really enjoyed my time doing combat sports.

Fast forward to 2020, when the global pandemic started and I wanted to get fit again. Bad timing for contact sports. 

Friends and family influenced me to try cycling and I immediately got hooked. At first I was doing short rides, then centuries, then double centuries. I had fun traveling, eating, and bonding with like minded individuals. So this idea had been in my head for months as we were cycling about.

At first, I toyed with the idea of documenting my cycling journey with the intention to impart knowledge. But then I knew that I wasn't an expert, so I really had nothing to share. So I guess I came to the realization what I really wanted to document was me experiencing how wonderful my cycling experience is. Some people get motivated by stats (I confess, there's still a part of me that still checks on Strava stats. lol.), but lately I'm more motivated by travel, food, and camaraderie.  I wanted to focus on that!

I guess the whole point of this is I also want to give back to the community in my own way. As I've had the time and support of friends who helped me get started, I want to motivate other potential (late bloomer) cyclists out there. <strong>If I can do it, they can do it too!</strong>

By the way, you can find us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/latebloomercycling" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/latebloomercycling" target="_blank">Instagram</a>. It would be most appreciated if you could like / follow us on our socials.

Thanks, and Ride Safe!

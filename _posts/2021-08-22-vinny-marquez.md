"Started cycling to work last July 2020. Required to be physically at work atleast once a week, 5km away from home.

I gradually fell in love with cycling and wanted to get a proper road bike. So I said to myself, I'd get one on my birthday and I did. October 1, 2020 I bought a Sepcialized Allez from BikeHub San Pedro and that was it. I was hooked!

Aside from the 20-50km weekday rides, we started going for century rides; eventually finishing a few double century rides.

I targetted 10,000 km for my first year, but due to quarantine restrictions and a few injuries I am only at around 5,000 km. I'll do better next year; hopefully."
